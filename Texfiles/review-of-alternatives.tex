			\subsection{Why do we need this?}
    			The review of existing alternatives is a thorough study of existing applications or solutions and literature that are related to your project. We do this for the following reasons:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item you get to see what other professionals or researchers and authors in the area where your topic falls have done or are currently doing;
                        \item you will have a deeper understanding of your topic and of the application that you are proposing to develop;
                        \item you will know if someone else has already done the same (if you are duplicating a project or a research); and
                        \item you will have an idea on how other people solved the problems that are similar to yours.
                    \end{itemize}
