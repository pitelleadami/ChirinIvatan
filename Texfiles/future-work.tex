\section{FUTURE WORK}
    This section of the document points towards potential improvements, expansions, or new lines of inquiry that follow from your project. This section is crucial – not just for academic projects, but also for industry projects – as it acknowledges that research is an ongoing process and that one project can't cover every aspect of the topic.\\
