# Chirin Ivatan

**Chirin Ivatan** is a community-based information system designed to preserve and
promote the Ivatan language and folklore through a web-based digital dictionary,
a folklore documentation archive, and community-driven content contributions.

The project addresses the fragmentation and inaccessibility of existing Ivatan
language resources by providing a centralized, interactive platform that supports
documentation, learning, and cultural participation—particularly for younger
generations, educators, and cultural advocates.
